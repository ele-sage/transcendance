----- How to use PostgreSQL -----

- Creating a new table

    CREATE TABLE cities (
        name varchar(80),
        location point
    );

    * whitespaces are ignored

- Populating a Table With Rows
    
    INSERT INTO cities VALUES ('San Francisco', '(-194.0, 53.0)');
    
    INSERT INTO cities (location, name)
        VALUES ('(-194.0, 53.0)', 'San Francisco');

    *  Constants that are not simple numeric values usually must be surrounded by single quotes (')
    *  Its better practice to specify the column names in the INSERT statement

- Querying a Table
    
    CREATE TABLE weather (
        city varchar(80),
        temp_lo int, -- low temperature
        temp_hi int, -- high temperature
        prcp real, -- precipitation
        date date
    );

    SELECT city, (temp_hi+temp_lo)/2 AS temp_avg, date FROM weather;

    SELECT * FROM weather WHERE city = 'San Francisco' AND prcp > 0.0;

    SELECT * FROM weather ORDER BY city;
    
    SELECT DISTINCT city FROM weather;

    *  The * is a wildcard that means "all columns"
    *  The semicolon (;) is a statement terminator
    *  The AS clause causes the output column to be labeled with the given name
    *  The WHERE clause restricts the operation to certain rows
    *  The ORDER BY clause sorts the output rows using the specified column or columns
    *  The DISTINCT key word eliminates duplicate rows from the output
    *  The SELECT statement is called a query
